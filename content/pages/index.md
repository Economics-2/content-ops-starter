This includes the balance of supply and demand in individual markets, the behavior of individual consumers (which is referred to as\_[consumer theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-theory.asp)), workforce demand, and how individual companies determine wages for their workforces.\n\n\n\nMacroeconomics has a much broader reach than microeconomics. Prominent areas of research in the field of macroeconomics concern the implications of fiscal policy,\_[locating](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apt.asp)\_the reasons for inflation or unemployment, the implications of government borrowing and economic growth on a nationwide scale. Macroeconomists also examine globalization and global trading patterns and perform comparative studies between different countries in areas such as living standards and economic growth.\n\n\n\nWhile the main difference between the two fields concerns the scale of the subjects under analysis, there are further differences.\n\n## The Evolution of Macroeconomics\n\nMacroeconomics developed as a discipline in its own right in the 1930s when it became apparent that classic economic theory derived from microeconomics was not always directly applicable to nationwide economic behavior. Classic economic theory assumes that economies always return to a state of equilibrium. In essence, this means that if demand for a product increases, the prices for that product get higher and individual companies rise to meet the demand. However, during the Great Depression, there was low output and wide-scale unemployment. Clearly, this did not indicate equilibrium on a macroeconomic scale.\n\n>\n>\n> In response to this,\_\n>\n> [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp)\n>\n> \_published \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,\" which identified the potential and reasons for a negative output gap over a prolonged period of time on a macroeconomic scale. Keynes' work, along with that of other economists, such as Irving Fisher, played a large role in establishing macroeconomics as a separate field of study.\n\n>\n\n## Special Considerations\n\nWhile there are differential lines between microeconomics and macroeconomics, they are interdependent to a large extent. A prime example of this interdependency is\_[inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp). Inflation and its implications for the cost of living are a common focus of investigation in the study of macroeconomics. However, since inflation raises the prices of services and commodities, it can also have acute implications for individual households and companies. Companies may be compelled to raise prices to respond to the increasing amounts that they have to pay for materials and the inflated wages they have to pay to their employees.\n\n\n\n## What Is the Difference Between Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Environment?\n\nIn economics, the term \"macro environment\" refers to the economic conditions that apply to the broader environment. This differs from what is called the \"micro environment,\" which refers to conditions specific to a business, sector, or small region.\n\n\n\n## What Is an Example of Microeconomics?\n\nExamples of microeconomics abound in everyday life. Consider a family of four. They may choose to develop and stick to a monthly budget that allocates money to various spending uses, including groceries, utilities, rent, and car payments. That budget may also include earmarked funds to use on leisure activities, including entertainment, dining out, and travel. Microeconomics would study how and why individuals and families allocate limited resources in the ways that they do.\n\n\n\n## What Is an Example of Macroeconomics?\n\nExamples of macroeconomics are also common. One of the most prominent macreconomic indicators, for instance, is the unemployment rate, a metric that is calculated monthly. This is a measure of the proportion of people who are not employed but actively seeking work. As a macroeconomic indicator, the unemployment hints at how wages may fluctuate, how consumer spending may trend, and even how businesses may perform.\n\n\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nMicroeconomics and macroeconomics are two important and interlinked fields of study. They differ in focus. While microeconomics examines the economic behavior of individuals, families, and businesses, macroeconomics looks at economies as they operate on a regional, national, or even international scale.\n\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual CashPut your trading skills to the test with our\_[FREE Stock Simulator.](https://adclick.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/click?xai=AKAOjsszdxp_oRyV09iohdrzSlej-oaUzTH8_XkbqtEfks8Dt_h418EIbq8vONZwx1WJckguiUVakczLb1Z7LpnQCFGF-tTgxrNNzQ2taAbJhWPS8F6ap6HeMHBEzBxpnJ84UQzyctsvzOklZ__4FOsmcjkKzDxXEX271Cgjpz-jxB-q1U_bIVC0LlO_8-DRVobCT0v1JDOnNRgzx62mRIrNptdew8lbaud4BYlmV28WBFTWJibIoq52Z2oKaPxFNBE_nn2mI9d9iurK5mI9GVtCwJMoAiPc0JcdPIj6PLFTCMTmehkU9QjtQ0KFD9Ao7H_3qoXBQdZgRE_AFtJLHkvuT6Frb45hRd0jBpyLFkP8CxJXl-Mw-vNhoYSCA6gpu7npvPb558xRZc1F3wH2Cb8laKgVVBkXD9bg9SDJjeNfpMy9oUs\\&sai=AMfl-YTOJXVIDSS6pZJzSnYS1Lw_jv1gtP2kOjonBjup6PW6Ad-tlDbgeuyXtTAP19h0tOYt6N6HEMMd-ctabOAVNkGz0xrC_KFWvEqzlfyFWXSwMtfFzm_p9x98J-qXDltY9Q\\&sig=Cg0ArKJSzKwji76N-HsBEAE\\&fbs_aeid=%5Bgw_fbsaeid%5D\\&urlfix=1\\&adurl=http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?source=dfp-ros-sim\\&subid=dfp-ros-sim)\_Compete with thousands of Investopedia traders and trade your way to the top!
